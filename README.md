# Flux WiFi Lightbulb

Created for a final project in a class. Using Flux's official app I would monitor the packet traffic sent to the lightbulb from the app. Figured out which byte does what by noting the packets after a change and making another change. Created a flask web app to control the light bulb to demostrate my findings.
